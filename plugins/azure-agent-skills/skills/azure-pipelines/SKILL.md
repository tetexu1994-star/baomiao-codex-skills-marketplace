description: Expert knowledge for Azure Pipelines development including troubleshooting, best practices, decision making, architecture & design patterns, limits & quotas, security, configuration, integrations & coding patterns, and deployment. Use when configuring YAML CI/CD, agents, service connections, Key Vault secrets, or deploying to Web Apps/Kubernetes, and other Azure Pipelines related development tasks. Not for Azure DevOps (use azure-devops), Azure Test Plans (use azure-test-plans), Azure Boards (use azure-boards), Azure Repos (use azure-repos).
compatibility: Requires network access. Uses mcp_microsoftdocs:microsoft_docs_fetch or fetch_webpage to retrieve documentation.

# Azure Pipelines Skill

This skill provides expert guidance for Azure Pipelines. Covers troubleshooting, best practices, decision making, architecture & design patterns, limits & quotas, security, configuration, integrations & coding patterns, and deployment. It combines local quick-reference content with remote documentation fetching capabilities.

## How to Use This Skill

> **IMPORTANT for Agent**: Use the **Category Index** below to locate relevant sections. For categories with line ranges (e.g., `L35-L120`), use `read_file` with the specified lines. For categories with file links (e.g., `[security.md](security.md)`), use `read_file` on the linked reference file

> **IMPORTANT for Agent**: If `metadata.generated_at` is more than 3 months old, suggest the user pull the latest version from the repository. If `mcp_microsoftdocs` tools are not available, suggest the user install it: [Installation Guide](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mcp/blob/main/README.md)

This skill requires **network access** to fetch documentation content:
- **Preferred**: Use `mcp_microsoftdocs:microsoft_docs_fetch` with query string `from=learn-agent-skill`. Returns Markdown.
- **Fallback**: Use `fetch_webpage` with query string `from=learn-agent-skill&accept=text/markdown`. Returns Markdown.

| Limits & Quotas | L74-L85 | Managing Azure Pipelines limits: agent quotas/concurrency, Microsoft/GitHub-hosted agent capabilities, image deprecations, parallel jobs, run retention, and large Universal Package handling. |
| Security | L86-L137 | Securing Azure Pipelines: auth for agents, service connections, secrets/Key Vault, permissions, approvals/checks, secure variables, CodeQL/dependency scanning, and policy/compliance controls. |
| Configuration | L138-L501 | Configuring Azure Pipelines: agents, triggers, environments, YAML schema, variables, deployment strategies, and detailed task/step options for builds, tests, and deployments. |
| Integrations & Coding Patterns | L502-L530 | Language-specific CI/CD pipeline examples, scripting patterns, and integrations (Git, Key Vault, Slack, ServiceNow, REST/Functions, Selenium) for building, testing, and automating Azure Pipelines. |
| Deployment | L531-L589 | Deploying apps and packages with Azure Pipelines: agent setup (Windows/Linux/macOS/containers), artifacts (NuGet/npm/Maven/etc.), and deployment to VMs, web apps, Kubernetes, SQL, and Azure resources. |
